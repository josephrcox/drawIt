# DrawIt

# What is this?
Very basic draw something clone app that I created in less than 24 hours. Built using HTML Canvas, Javascript, with MongoDB and NodeJS.

Playable here - https://www.drawit.lol/

Cloning requires a MongoDB database stored as DATABASE_URL in .env

Post-24-hours I have made several improvements to the UX including game history, commenting on games, a live feed, and more!
